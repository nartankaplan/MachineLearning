# MachineLearning
Predicting "Are the mushrooms poisonous or edible?" with using supervised learning.
#
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a 
mushroom is edible or poisonous based on various physical characteristics of mushrooms, 
such as cap shape, color, surface texture, and lamellar attachment. Machine learning offers the 
potential to analyze complex patterns in data, improving identification accuracy and 
contributing to safer mushroom picking.

# Dataset Overview

This dataset is based on the physical properties of mushrooms (hat shape, surface structure, color, 
body height, etc.) according to which it indicates whether they are poisonous or edible. The data set is 
taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains both categorical and numerical data. 

• Number of Instances (Rows): 61,069 

• Number of Features (Columns): 20, including both numerical and categorical featues 

• Types of Features: Categorical and Numerical 

• Target Variable: class (e: edible, p: poisonous) 

• Duplicate Entries: 146 duplicate entries exist
